    <title> Online Shopping Survey </title>

    A small survey was conducted on a random group of people about their online shopping habits. The results are the following: 

  </p>

        <div >
            
        <img src="survey1.PNG" />
        
</div>

<p>

  A majority of the survey-takers report online shopping at least once a month, while those who have never done it are in the minority.

Education level, while appears to be mostly college students due to the sample size, it does indicate that education level is irrelevant when it comes to online shopping. At least not to a noticable degree.

</div>

  Similarly, people of all ages tend to online shop, as it appears it has become a necessity especially due to COVID-19 times.
